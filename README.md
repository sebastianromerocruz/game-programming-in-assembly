<h1 align=center><em>Nintendo Entertainment System</em>: Game Programming in Assembly</h1>

### **Motivation**

Since its humble beginnings in the 70s as specialised hardware such as _Pong™_, video game programming has matured into an integrated and accessible practice; modern developers can now realise an entire project without having to write a single line of code and, even if one does, one hardly ever has to worry about the behaviour that modern libraries such as OpenGL and Metal abstracts away.

The following lecture will cover the three basic game design principles of animation, "physics", and controller input through the lens of an assembly language with only three 16-bit registers and a memory allowance of only 40 kilobytes. Students will thus gain a reinforced command of computer architecture, low-level programming, and a general awareness of game development practices.

### **Topics**

- **Simple Animation**: Sprite Movement
- **Physics**: Storing and Loading States
- **Controller Input**: Bitwise Operations

### **Pre-Requisites**

6502 assembly, being quite old and decidedly out of fashion, previous knowledge of its specific [**syntax rules and quirks**](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/6502_Assembly) is not necessary. However, a solid background in memory management, computer architecture, bitwise operations and manipulation, and _an_ assembly language is encouraged and might result in a more rewarding experience.

### **Materials**

This lecture is designed to be actively followed by any who wish to write code along with the professor. For those interested in following the examples included in the lecture, feel free to download the starting materials (will be uploaded shortly before the beginning of the lecture) from [**this Google Drive folder**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nudoX785eN5eIYb2iIb-FhAEvBgaj6ie?usp=sharing).

Online tools that will be used during the lecture are listed below:

- [**6502 Assembly Instruction Set**](https://www.masswerk.at/6502/6502_instruction_set.html)
- [**6502 Virtual Assembler**](https://www.masswerk.at/6502/assembler.html)

### **Speaker**

**Professor Sebastián Romero Cruz** _(b. Mexico City, México)_ is a adjunct computer science instructor at both NYU Tandon School of Engineering and Pace University's Seidenberg School Of Computer Science and Information Systems. 

Having received their undergraduate degree in chemical and biomolecular engineering and their graduate degree in computer science, they encourage a multi-faceted, inclusive approach to programming pedagogy. This policy, combined with a philosophy of complete and unconditional empathy for students of varying backgrounds and needs, are the means through which their courses are administered.

Outside of computer science, Prof. Romero Cruz enjoys learning about French history and impressionism, playing music, and studying the Japanese language.
