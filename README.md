### **Motivation**

Since its humble beginnings in the 70s as specialised hardware, video game development has matured into an integrated and accessible practice; modern developers can now realise an entire project without having to write a single line of code. Even if one does, one hardly ever has to worry about the behaviour that contemporary game engines, such as Unity and Unreal—and even modern libraries such as OpenGL and Metal—abstract away. While the democratisation of a field is certainly not a bad thing, due to this general trend the historical and intrinsic role that hardware has played in game programming is often underappreciated—an unfortunate loss, considering that it can prove to be an immersive and creative tool in computer architecture pedagogy.

The following lecture will cover the three basic game design principles of **animation**, **physics**, and **controller input** through the lens of an assembly language with only three general-purpose, 8-bit registers and minimal memory allowance. Students will thus gain a reinforced command of computer architecture, low-level programming, and a general awareness of game development practices.

### **Topics**

1. **Assembly Operations**: Loops
2. **Simple Animation**: Sprite Movement
3. **Controller Input**: Bitwise Operations

### **Materials**

This lecture is designed to be actively followed by any who wish to write code along with the professor. For those interested in following the examples included in the lecture, feel free to use the following online tools:

- [**6502 Virtual Assembler**](https://www.masswerk.at/6502/assembler.html)
- [**nestopia**](https://nestopia.sourceforge.net/) NES emulator
- [**6502 Assembly Instruction Set**](https://www.masswerk.at/6502/6502_instruction_set.html)
- [**NES Sprite Editor**](https://eonarheim.github.io/NES-Sprite-Editor/)

### **Pre-Requisites**

Being rather old and with spotty online documentation, previous knowledge of the specific [**syntax rules and quirks**](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/6502_Assembly) of 6502 assembly is not necessary. However, a solid background in memory management, computer architecture, bitwise operations and manipulation, and _an_ assembly language is encouraged and might result in a more rewarding experience.

### **Speaker**

**Professor Sebastián Romero Cruz** _(b. Mexico City, México)_ is a adjunct computer science instructor at both NYU Tandon School of Engineering and Pace University's Seidenberg School Of Computer Science and Information Systems. 

Having received their undergraduate degree in chemical and biomolecular engineering and their graduate degree in computer science, they encourage a multi-faceted, inclusive approach to programming pedagogy. This policy, combined with a philosophy of complete and unconditional empathy for students of varying backgrounds and needs, are the means through which their courses are administered.

Outside of computer science, Prof. Romero Cruz enjoys learning about French history and impressionism, playing music, and studying the Japanese language.
